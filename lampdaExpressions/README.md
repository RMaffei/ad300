Intro to Lampda Expressions

This project introduced me to lampda expressions and how to create simple tasks, adding custom functional interfaces, and leveraging those expressions. The ‘Task’ interface extends ‘Runnable’ and allows tasks to be executed by a thread and made the code a lot more readable. MathOperations performs basic arithmetic, while Racers sorts a list of F1 Racers and filters names based on criteria. Using built-in interfaces can allow us to check if strings are empty or converting the strings to a specific format. 

How to Run:

1. Download and compile files from repo.
2. Run Main.java 
3. All Expressions are displayed in output window.
