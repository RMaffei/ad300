Queue Manager

This Java project simulates a waiting queue inspired by my favorite taco stand. It was great practice to see how to manage the order of customers and to check for validity. It is a simple, text-based program to add, serve, and check the status of customers. You can also display the queue size and display the current waiting list. 

How to Run:

1.	Clone or download the repository
2.	Navigate to the project directory
3.	Compile and run ‘TacoStandApp.java’
