 Intro to Java Stream API

A hands-on introduction to the Java Stream API that showcases the capabilities to perform different operations on collections. With the use of key stream operations, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, I was able to gain an understanding on how to leverage the Stream API in an application. The ability to map integers to their squares, combine the operations, and create flat nested lists can group numbers based on specific criteria. This makes the API a flexible way to handle diverse data tasks. 

How to Run:

1. Download and compile files from repo.
2. Run StreamExample.java. 
3. The integers are displayed, transformed, and aggregated to be displayed in the output console.
