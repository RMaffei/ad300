Book Sorter

Overview:

In this project, I was able to utilize multiple practices to create a book catalog, features to sort through books with different criteria, and other organization by using the Comparator interface. There are different Comparator classes to sort by title, author, year published, etc and a class to chain the author and title together. 

How to Run: 


1.	Clone or download project files from GitHub repository.
2.	Open and compile files
3.	Run ‘Main.java’ 
4.	Books are sorted in different ways and displayed underneath these test cases.
