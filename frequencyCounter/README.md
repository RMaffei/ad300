Word Frequency Counter

Overview:

This program utilizes a hashmap to store words as keys and their frequencies as values. This was a great example of sharing values within a key and allowed for a more effective way of retrieving and updating the value. This program is not case sensitive and allows it to be alphabetically sorted, which creates an organized list as an output. 

How to Run: 


1.	Clone or download project files from GitHub repository.
2.	Open and compile ‘freqCounter.java’
3.	Enter text or use paragraph from generator website. 
4.	Type ‘exit’ when finished with entries.
5.	Displayed results will be the frequency of each word from the inputted text.
