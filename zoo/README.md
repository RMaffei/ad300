 Polymorphic Zoo

This project demonstrates principles of polymorphism using a zoo with animal objects that interact with the same interface but behave differently. Each animal has its own sound and there is an overloaded method to implement a multiplier that causes them to make two extra sounds on top of the original statement. This was a great example in inheritance, polymorphism, and method overloaded and reinforced the principles needed to create flexible and reusable code. 

How to Run:

1. Download and compile files from repo.
2. Run ZooDemo.java 
3. The methods are displayed in the output window.
