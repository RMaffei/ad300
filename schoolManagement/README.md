School Management System

Overview:

In this project and by building a school management, the different levels of a school from every student to every department is compartmentalized. This is a great example of aggregation, which references multiple classes and reflect relationships between them. Running main.java will give you a list of teachers and students. This has been a fundamental lesson in object-oriented programmingâ€™s strengths in using objects to represent real world applications. 

How to Run: 

1.	Clone or download project files from GitHub repository.
2.	Compile and run Main.java. 
3.	Displays all faculty and students when ran.
