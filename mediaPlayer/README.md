Media Player Simulation

Overview:

This was my first project dealing with interfaces and implementing them to simulate a media player program. By using the interface and implementing it in different classes, it demonstrates modular, expandable, and specific behaviors based on media. This has been one my favorite projects so far and I liked the practical example of abstracting and limiting need to modify files. The MediaPlayer can be implemented in various ways and other features can be added to these subclasses which is great for scaling. 

How to Run: 

1.	Clone or download project files from GitHub repository.
2.	Compile and run Main.java. 
3.	Simulates the actions of each player.
