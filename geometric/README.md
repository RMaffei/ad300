Simple Geometric Application

Overview:

To better understand abstract classes and inheritance, this program is to be designed in a way to demonstrate a hierarchy where common interfaces can be used and subclasses are used to implement their own unique methods (i.e calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter(). 
This is used a practice with inheritance and overriding methods. By using abstract classes and methods, I can make calculations specific to each subclass/shape. There will be shared behavior between subclasses, but this allows for better maintainability and allows new subclasses to be added in the future. 


How to Run: 

1.	Clone or download project files from GitHub repository.
2.	Compile and run Main.java. 
3.	Edit parameters for shape objects to achieve desired results.
