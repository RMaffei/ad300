Iterators in ArrayList, HashMap, TreeMap

Overview:

This project demonstrates use of data structures and how to manipulate and manage the collection of this data. I used the ArrayList to store book titles and the ability to add and remove books from storage. HashMaps are useful for storing book categories as keys and the inventory for each book as a value. TreeMaps make it useful to store the books via their ISBN number as a key and allows us to iterate over the map to display the matching titles and keys. The functionality allows us to manage the books and organize them based on their ISBN.
